# Flow Stochastic Lattice Model

This code implements stochastic lattice model, with the ability to model granular flows which undergo crushing, segregation and mixing.

## Getting Started

Just download a copy and run `python FlowSLM.py <input_name>` where `<input_name>` is the name of the parameter file located in the `input` directory.

### Prerequisites

You will need a full python3 environment installed. I recommend [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for this.
